Bobblehead Wars VR
=======================

This is the VR version of the tutorial Bobblehead Wars of the book Unity Games by Tutorials.
This version of the game only works with VR Boxes and Bluetooth Joysticks just like the ones on the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ5S4Sk1lVM


Usage
-----
In the GameManager script there is a variable named DesktopMode. If it is set to true you can use some keys to emulate the behaviour when playing the game on Unity.
Remember to change DesktopMode to false when you build your project to iOS or it won't work.
You need to add the code on the repo https://github.com/Saraceni/UnityMobileBluetoothController_iOS to you XCode Project to make it work.
